• Students are reminded that they are working with prototypes and that
prototypes are not to be left powered unattended despite the connectivity that
they develop.

• The small physical prototypes that you build are to be safe enough to be
worked on at home and small enough to be carried with you.

• In alignment with the space below the tray in the Humber North Campus
Electronics Parts kit the overall project maximum dimensions are

12 13/16" x 5 ¹/₂" x 2 ³/₄" = 32.5cm x 14cm x 7cm.

• Keeping safety and Z462 in mind, the highest AC voltage that is to be used is
16Vrms from a wall adapter from which +/- 15V or as high as 45 VDC can be
obtained. Maximum power consumption is to be 20 Watts.

• If your PCB doesn’t work or you need to switch sensors/effectors, it is
recommended that you use the SparkFun Qwiic system:

• A passing grade for this course is 50%. To get an overall passing grade in
this course, students must independently pass the Reporting and the Project
Demonstration portions of the course. If one or more of these sections is less
than 50% then the final grade for the course will be the lower of the two marks.

• Late Submission penalty: 10% penalty per day for late submissions.

• Classroom attendance is mandatory for grading, the student will get zero for
the submission if they missed the session for the corresponding week.
