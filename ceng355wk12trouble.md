# CENG 355 Week 12 Troubleshooting, Project Demonstration

## Weekly checks for every student:
- [ ] Present in person in a safe manner for the duration of the class: glasses, no food/drink, etc.
- [ ] Hardware and any other project equipment present.

## This class
Project functionality demonstration /10.   
This class will provide time for you to be able to actually do your presentation and demonstration, and continue to troubleshoot issues.   
If your team is ready to present then you should plan to do so to gain feedback.   
You must be ready to with final presentation for week 13.   

### Presentations
The recommended structure for the presentation is as follows
Explain and be able to demonstrate

- /4 The functionality of each sensor/effector
- /4 The hardware and enclosure   
- /4 How the database interacts with each sensor and effector
- /4 The database architecture and design 
- /4 Mobile application interaction with the database and / or each sensor and effector   

The grading will be based on
- the content of the slides
- how well you orally present the material
- how well the demonstration is coordinated with both the content and the 

### Technical Reports
The technical report is to be completed according to the OACETT guidelines, and the ceng355report.md template. 

The technical report content can include content from or links to the work done earlier in this course and the precursor courses. 
The teams should NOT have to reproduce all this work. You have effectively been developing the technical report content during the project.
However if the application or hardware has changed then you may need to update and resubmit these documents if you link out to them. 

#### Reuse material
Thus content developed in this course and the precursor courses can be reused or linked to in the relevant sections.

- Executive Summary from the proposal produced during CENG355
- Declaration of authorship (include an updated table of contributions and the declarations)
- The OACETT Report Checklists produced during CENG355
- Gannt Chart - you can include links to the GitHub Project and its associated milestones and issues that you have been maintaining throughout CENG355. 
- The Poster / presentation produced in CENG355
- The troubleshooting report and other CENG355 progress reports
- mobile deliverables - The mobile application report(s) produced in the CENG322 Software Project
- Hardware deliverables - The hardware reports produced in the CENG317 Hardware Production Technology course

#### New Material
You will need to produce some original material. The key sections that will contain new material be the results, conclusions and associated recommendations. 

- End to End Integration - The database integration and end to end integration is new and must be described in the relevant sections of the report. 
- Results - Does your solution work? Include any data analysis, graphs, etc. that show the data from the sensors / effectors, how the data has been prepared or aggregated for display in the applications.
- Conclusion - free of the above discussion, explanation and opinion. What have you learned, what did you have to change from original proposal, what might you do differently in future
- Recommendations - Enhancements, next steps (develop more advanced prototype, move to pilot project, go into production, go to a start-up incubator, etc).
  
#### Joint Declaration - Table of Contributions
You will notice from the OACETT Guidelines page 3 and 4 and from the PowerPoint presentation Joint Declaration Directions https://learn.humber.ca/ultra/courses/_235686_1/outline/file/_17191432_1 that a table is required describing how each team members contributed to each major section of the document. This can be done at either the Heading 1 and / or Heading 2 level. This must be on a separate page above the joint declaration statements. 

- Heading 1 : the major sections e.g. 1.0 Introduction, 2.0 Hardware Development Platform Report, etc.
- Heading 2 : the level 1 subsections e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2.
