# Database Status Update
## Recent and current progress
The app saves the user's login and profile information in our Firebase database using Firestore. Users are able to update their information, which is simultaneously updated in the database. Using Firestore, we also provide the user with their health records as they are being recorded. This process had to be tried in a few different ways to make it seamlessly work with the app. Users are allowed to send feedback, which is saved and stored in the database.
## Problems and hyperlinks/urls to potential solutions
Having trouble syncing graphs with the Firebase database, and the graphs aren't producing what should be happening
To find and address the problem, look at the Firebase database settings and data retrieval procedures. The database's data will also be checked for consistency with the desired format. To make sure they produce the appropriate outcome, the graphs will be changed to solve the graph-related problem.
