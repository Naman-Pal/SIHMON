# Hardware Status Update
## Recent and current progress
We finished the schematic and breadboard design of the circuit, along with the PCB design on the Fritzing software.
We created the Gerber design and assembled the physical PCB, including adding header for each sensor, and one extra header.
All of the individual sensors have been tested on the physical PCBs, along with the LED circuits, and all tests were successful.

### Ongoing tasks
We are currenty working on a 3D case to contain all 4 of our sensors along with the PCB. We are also testing all 4 sensors together on the same PCB. 

## Problems and hyperlinks/urls to potential solutions
Our current problem is to find a sturdy design for our encasement of PCB, and the bracelet, which can fit on a baby's wrist/leg, and be comfortable to wear. Here are the links we have considered: -

## Financial
### Expenditures since previous report
There have not been any big expenditures, however, we have had minor expenditures.
We have ordered more 40 pin headers, and shortpin headers to accommodate all 4 sensors onto the same PCB, it costed us $30.

### Planned future expenses
We will get padding and more comfortable material for our bracelet to make it more wearable, which would cost approximately extra $50.
