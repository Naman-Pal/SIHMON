**Insperational Message - Why we are here at Humber College**
Remember that we are all on the figurative bus to the skills competition (job search) where, after completing 5.5 semesters, this is indeed where you belong and are able to say:
1. I belong in this academic community.
2. My ability and competence grow with my effort.
3. I can succeed at this.
4. This work has value for me.   
(Camille A. Farrington, 2012)

## Weekly checks for every student:
- [ ] Present in person in a safe manner for the duration of the class: glasses, no food/drink, etc.
- [ ] Hardware and any other project equipment present.

## Poster Draft due Friday November 10 2023 at 11pm
**Poster hints and tips.**
Reuse text that you have from the proposal and other submissions as the basis of your poster content.
Be careful of spelling, punctuation and grammar. You are trying to impress potential partners. The ability to write clearly and consisely is a key skill, especially in the technology space where jargon and acornyms are used generously. 

-- SUMMARISE : There is a temptation to present very dense text on presentations. No one has the time to read it all. 
-- SUMMARISED bullet points - each point preferably one line, maximum two lines. First 2-3 words of each bullet may act as header to convey the subject of the bullet. **Bold them ** for emphaisis. 
-- LEGIBLE - choose large enough font size. Should be comfortably readable by someone about 50-100cm away. 
-- DIAGRAMS - a picture is worth a thousand words. A well thought out and briefly notated diagram can vastly aid understanding. 
-- TABLES - are good at presenting data 2-5 columns max, 5-8 rows max. Again resist the remptation for high density of infomation - less is more.

- [Poster Template](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/ceng355wk05hardwareconnstatus/blob/main/HUM_Poster_Template.pptx), upload updated pptx AND a pdf version.
- Example [GreenSense](https://github.com/ryanmcadie/GreenSense/blob/4c6248bee2d33b034694df6a5dcf572f0dbefccd/Presentations/GreenSensePoster.pptx.pdf).
- Unit testing -> consider testing each component separately.
- Production testing -> consider what you would testing if a thousand came off an assembly line before sending them to customers.
